# Nand-to-tetris

Nand-to-tetris is a practical course that guides you along the process of building a virtual computer from the ground up.
Your journey of building your virtual computer starts wih implementing logic gates, learning about concepts such as Boolean Algebra and Boolean Arithmetic, and goes all the way up to programming your very own operating system.

This repository serves as my implementation of the practical exercises as laid out in the modules.
